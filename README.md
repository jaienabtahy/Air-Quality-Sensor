# Air Quality Detection and Prediction [Ongoing]
This is a portfolio project developed by [Jaien Abtahi] under the CUNY ASRC Environmental Sciences Lab. The project involves air quality detection, data collection, and prediction using various technologies.

## Overview
The project aims to detect and predict air quality using custom-built sensors, Google Sheets for data collection, and random forests for prediction. The air quality detection system is built using an Arduino board, which measures various air quality parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and particulate matter (PM). The data collected from the sensors is then stored in a Google Sheets document for further analysis.

The project also includes a prediction model based on random forests, which is trained on the collected data. The model predicts the air quality based on the sensor measurements and provides valuable insights into air quality trends over time. This information can be used to make informed decisions about pollution reduction measures and help improve overall air quality.
